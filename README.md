# ogRest API's 
This project was generated with [https://gorest.co.in/]

This small project helps in understanding basics of api validations and monitoring
also, it is going to give clear idea about different https methods like POST,GET,PUT and DELETE operations
a CRUD operations user cycle is built using api collections, starting from create user, edit, update and deleting user

## goRest collections importing into postman

Import goRest.postman_collection.json into postman tool 
All the required pre-request scripts and tests are already set
Import goRest.postman_enviornment.json config into enviornment tab

Note : the access token is required , this can be access through profile from goRest website

## Running API validation 
first select goRest enviornment 
select create user api and click on send 
now you can see the reponse under response body
repeat above 3 steps for other api's and see the response

## Runner API monitoring
using default runner from postman
this will help in monitoring api's continously
